        <h2>Step-by-step directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven
                over medium heat until well browned.<br>
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.<br>
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil,
                1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.</br>
                Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br>
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.<br>
                In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,
                remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of
                    a 9x13-inch baking dish.<br>
                    Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.<br>
                    Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.<br>
                    Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.<br>
                    Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and
                    sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.<br>
                    Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and
                    Parmesan cheese.<br>
                    Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with
                    cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.<br>
                Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.<br>
                Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.<br>
            </li>
