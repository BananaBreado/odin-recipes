        <div class="headers"><h2>Description</h2></div>
        <p class="description">Beef Wellington is a dish in which, a cutlet of beef tenderloin
            is first coated in mustard/patè, then covered
            with duxelles(mushroom mince) and wrapped around a puff pastry, then
            it is ultimately cooked in a pre-heated oven</p>

        <div class="headers"><h2>Ingredients required:</h2></div>

                Allow the oven to preheat to 400°F as you assemble the
                Wellington.

            <li>
                <p>
                Season the beef generously with salt and pepper.<br>
                Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan on high heat.<br>
                Sear the beef in the pan on all sides until well browned,
                about 2 to 3 minutes per side.<br>
                (Hint: do not move the beef until it has had a chance to brown.)<br>

                Remove the beef from the pan and let cool.<br>
                Once cooled, brush the beef on all sides with mustard.

                Chop the mushrooms and put them into a food processor.<br>
                Pulse until very finely chopped.<br>
                Heat the sauté pan on medium-high heat.<br>
                Transfer the mushroom mixture into the pan and cook, allowing
                the mushrooms to release their moisture, 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
                When the moisture released by the mushrooms has all boiled away,
                remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside to cool.<br>

                    Roll out a large piece of plastic wrap.<br>
                    Lay out the slices of ham on the plastic wrap so that they
                    overlap and are large enough to wrap around and encapsulate
                    the beef.<br>
                    Spread the mushroom mixture over the ham.<br>

                    Place the beef in the middle and roll the mushroom and ham
                    over the beef, using the plastic wrap so that you do this
                    tightly.<br>
                    Wrap up the beef into a tight barrel shape, twisting the
                    ends of the plastic wrap to secure.<br>
                    Refrigerate for 20 minutes.<br>

                    Unwrap the beef from the plastic wrap and place in the

                    Place on a small plate, seam side down,
                    and brush beaten egg yolks all over the top.<br>
                    Chill for 5 to 10 minutes.<br>

                    Bake at 400°F for 25 to 35 minutes.<br>
                    The pastry should be nicely golden when done.<br>
                    To ensure that your roast is medium rare, test with
                    an instant read meat thermometer.<br>

                    Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.<br>
                    Slice in 1-inch thick slices.<br>
                    Leftover slices can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days.<br>
                    Wrap tightly with foil and reheat in a 350°F oven.<br>
                    Once warm, remove the foil and bake for a few minutes more
                    to crisp the pastry.<br>
                    Note that reheated slices will be closer to medium or
                    well-done.<br>
