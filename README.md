# odin-recipes
This project will be a simple html site for food recipes, it will introduce each
dish to the user with a list of the ingredients and step-by-step process on to
use those ingredients to make the dish.

# What will i learn after finishing this project
I will learn a basic understanding of adding paragraphs of text in HTML, and
also learning how to use html tags to change pieces of text to bold and italic.

I will learn to add images of the dishes alongside the recipes.

I will learn how to add links to my recipes site that might redirect to other
sites or other pages relative to my recipe site.

I will learn how to add alt text description to the img tags, so that visually
impaired people can browse my site correctly and understand what content does
my site holds.

I will learn to add boiler plate HTML lines of text, which is required for every
html project to work.
